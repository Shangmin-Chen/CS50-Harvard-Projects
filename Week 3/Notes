Linear search is bad,
log search is way faster.

establish lists by doing

int numbers[] = {1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 3};

with that you dont have to establish how many in a list like before.

using <string.h>
we can use strcmp(item1, item2), if it equals then return 0, then if item1 is alphabetically before item2 then return -number, otherwise +number. It's Ascii values.

if you use strcmp in an if statement, make sure its strcmp(item1, item2) == 0;

use string for numbers if you're not gonna do math on it.

New syntax

typedef struct
{
  string name;
  string number;
}
person;

int main(void)
{
  person people[2];
  people[0].name = "Brian"
  people[0].number = "+1-123-123-1234"
  
  people[1].name = ""
  people[1].number = ""
}
