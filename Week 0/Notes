Professor talked about base2 (I knew already)
talked about bits, bytes and stuff, which I learned from AP COMPSCI.
0 and 1, which I knew too...
professor explained how the 0 and 1 would apply to computers.. which I already knew too..
8 bit = bytes and maximum possibility is 256, highest value is 255 (Knew this too)
Professor is talking about efficiency and correctness tradeoff, improving upon an algorithm, he demonstrates this by using a phone book as an example, skipping pages increase efficiency but also decreases accuracy.
Professor started tearing phonebooks in half... actually a pretty smart design for the solution...
If theres 1000 pages, going one by one to find what you're looking for takes 1000 flips, if you're tearing the book in half, it takes 10 tears in total.
Professor just leaked his number 949-468-(2750)
1 page at a time slope = n
2 page at a time slope = n/2
half of the book at a time = log base 2 n
Professor started to talk about pseudocode, talking about logic and steps and stuff, which I'm really familiar with since I learned python for APCOMPSCI.
NOW WE'RE CODING BABY!!!! but scratch... really... scratch???... At least we're coding :) check out project file in week 0 folder.
I only did the first few, the last few was basically modules in python and def blocks in python, the def blocks used parameter and arguments.
check out the dababy project
final notes: ok, just finished week 0, actually really high quality, although I already know literally everything the professor talked about. I'm really looking forward to the introduction of other languages.
I just finished their problem set today and also recorded the hello video. Not much I could do on scratch but I made a simple game. Week 0 (completed) | week 1 incoming ðŸ˜ˆ
