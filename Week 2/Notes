20:30 into the video, its kinda late at night so im going to sleep, but so far the professor started to explain a lot of the stuff that I wanted to know on week 1

He explained the complier, which is very interesting, I wish he would've explained when he first introduced it but its fine.

Complier we're using is clang, it takes the C code and converts it into assembly code then into 1's and 0's aka machine code.

the make function that was included in the cs50 library is actually mostly just

clang -o (name of file) (c file)

but if you have an added library from #include then you have to link it

clang -o (name of file) (c file) -l(library)

-o stands for output

-l stands for link

omg... i just found out how a debugger works... I've been trying to debug with print for so long. My teacher is actually trolling by not teaching us how to use a debugger.

debugger is going to be my best friend when im writing a harder code.

rubber ducky debug sounds very stupid but may be also very very helpful

50 minutes in 50:42, professor is now finally onto the topic of arrays.

Professor is now talking about bytes and rams, very interesting because now we're relating to hardware.

----
// how to set up arrays

//int array_name[total_number_of_items];
int scores[3];
// declaring items in list
scores[0] = value1;
scores[1] = value2;
scores[2] = value3;
----
turns out that strings are just characters in an array.
if string array has 3 total values
array[3];
then that means that you can store up to 3 values. [0][1][2] and then [3] is not accessible but is occupied with \0 which tells the array that it ends *null char
\0 ascii is null aka value 0

ohhhh man things are getting interesting with looking at memory... i touched on this with CTF but now I really do hope the professor elaborates on this topic
----
aug 18 21, professor did not dig deeper into memory, but he did mention how the array of arrays and ascii int helps make encrypted messages.
these messages are created by having input, key, and output.

Note *
I'm going to take a break on cs50 to work on a udemy course I bought, Im trying to create a website for my mom's business. It's a 60 hour course so I'll be back on
cs50 full time after a week or so because I still have summer work in between.
