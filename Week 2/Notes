20:30 into the video, its kinda late at night so im going to sleep, but so far the professor started to explain a lot of the stuff that I wanted to know on week 1

He explained the complier, which is very interesting, I wish he would've explained when he first introduced it but its fine.

Complier we're using is clang, it takes the C code and converts it into assembly code then into 1's and 0's aka machine code.

the make function that was included in the cs50 library is actually mostly just

clang -o (name of file) (c file)

but if you have an added library from #include then you have to link it

clang -o (name of file) (c file) -l(library)

-o stands for output

-l stands for link

------ time for bed :) Aug 17 21

omg... i just found out how a debugger works... I've been trying to debug with print for so long. My teacher is actually trolling by not teaching us how to use a debugger.

debugger is going to be my best friend when im writing a harder code.

rubber ducky debug sounds very stupid but may be also very very helpful

50 minutes in 50:42, professor is now finally onto the topic of arrays.

Professor is now talking about bytes and rams, very interesting because now we're relating to hardware.
