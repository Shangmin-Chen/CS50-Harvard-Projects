20:30 into the video, its kinda late at night so im going to sleep, but so far the professor started to explain a lot of the stuff that I wanted to know on week 1

He explained the complier, which is very interesting, I wish he would've explained when he first introduced it but its fine.

Complier we're using is clang, it takes the C code and converts it into assembly code then into 1's and 0's aka machine code.

the make function that was included in the cs50 library is actually mostly just

clang -o (name of file) (c file)

but if you have an added library from #include then you have to link it

clang -o (name of file) (c file) -l(library)

-o stands for output

-l stands for link
