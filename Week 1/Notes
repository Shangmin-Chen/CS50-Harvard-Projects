Ok, week 1's work is on C, harvard cs50 wants me to use their ide, but ill rather use vscode.
professor just dumped a code on us. the program was:
------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world");
}
------------------------
ok ok, 2 hours in, the thing is in my muscle memory now

new code with loops
------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

// prototype
void meow(int n);

int main(void)

{
    meow(3);
}


void meow(int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            printf("MEOW!\n");
        }
}
------------------------
very intersting, C is a very interesting yet very not coder friendly language
the cs50 ide is not bad... 

found something interesting, the do while functions, it doesnt exist in python but it seems useful in some instances
example
------------------------
int n;
do
{
    n = get_int("width: ");
}
while (n <  1);
------------------------
this just means that ask for input first no matter what, then if n is less than 1, ask whatever is in do again, if n is more than 1 then the code proceeds. 
This makes sure that the user enters positive value.

professor just wrote a nested for loop in C, very long 
example
------------------------
for (int i = 0, i < 3, i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0, j < 3, j++)
            {
                printf("#")
            }
        printf("\n")
    } 
------------------------
professor mentioned something funny, the Y2K, which was very intersting and I saw on youtube before and also he mentioned that- 
in 19 january, 2038 the world might experience Y2K again because the 32 bits stored in seconds would ran out. In 1 january, 1970 was when the counter started.
When the date comes, instead of the actual date, the date would be back to 1/1/1970, just like Y2K when it went to 1900 instead of 2000
NICE CLASS 8/10 VERY NEWBIE FRIENDLY :)
