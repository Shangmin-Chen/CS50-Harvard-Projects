Ok, week 1's work is on C, harvard cs50 wants me to use their ide, but ill rather use vscode.
professor just dumped a code on us. the program was:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world");
}

ok... so the professor just turned the code into binary... source code into machine code, source code is c and machine code is binary, 
a complier turns source code into machine code.

oh god, the cs50 ide the professor used is so ancient

tried to use terminal to open up my hello world code but i didnt work, permisson denied. then i remembered a CTF from picoCTF by CMU and used chmod +x on the file...
broke my whole workplace.....

Ok.. so its completely broken...

Im reinstalling vscode now... 

still not working. i broke the ide.

oh nice i fixed it. i used the debugger and it worked, idk how but it did B)

professor is using a cs50 library. I dont have access to that.. I'll write some functions tonight and put it into my own library.

im almost 40 minutes into the video... professor is just putting code up without explaining them.. telling me to take it with faith... hope he explains it soon.
